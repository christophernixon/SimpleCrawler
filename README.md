### Considerations
- Testing: testing correct behaviour & performance
- Multi-threading
- Taking user input for domain
- Advantages of using statics
- Properly checking for successful codes
- Avoid anchors in urls
- It seems like the method for fetching all links on a page might be a bit broken?
- DFS vs BFS?
